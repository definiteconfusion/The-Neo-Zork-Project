## Neo-Zork
This project seeks to recreate both Zork I and Zork II in completely, just in Python this time. All rooms (and their details) are stored within a simple Sqlite3 database making it easy to add, remove, or change rooms as you see fit. 

## Zork I - 1981
It beckons you into a world fraught with danger and discovery. Using all the cunning you can muster, you'll plunge far below the surface of the earth in search of the incomparable Treasures of Zork. But this is no mere treasure hunt. During your amazing journey, you'll come face to face with creatures so outlandish, they defy description. And you'll wander through an underground domain so vast, with so many twists and turns, it can offer you new sur- prises no matter how many times you explore it.
